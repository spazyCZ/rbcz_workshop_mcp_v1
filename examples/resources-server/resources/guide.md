# Guide Resource

This guide expands on how resources might be used:

1. List resources (names, mime types, descriptions)
2. Allow model or user to pick one
3. Read content (possibly chunk or stream if large)
4. Optionally cache or embed for retrieval

Security Considerations:
- Only expose non-sensitive files
- Consider access control and redaction in production

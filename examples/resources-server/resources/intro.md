# Intro Resource

This is a sample resource document exposed via the resources.list and resources.read methods.

Key Points:
- Resources let the server surface passive context (documents, configs, datasets)
- The client decides what (if any) to forward into model context
- Reading is explicit: a model can request listing first, then select specific items
